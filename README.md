Simple script to create and use a self-contained Arduino IDE configuration specifically for building Marlin firmware.

Launch "setupArduino" to create the configuration directories. Use "launchArduino" to start the Arduino IDE using the same. Symlinking "launchArduino" to a folder included in PATH is recommended.

#Caution
Setup script uses the "rm -rf" command. Use with care.
